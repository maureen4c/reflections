Here are my notes from the Git lessons:

First Control and Click on file allows you to download

The command for file compare is different for Windows:

The comparable command in Linux is:

diff -u fileold.js filenew.js


the git command window is in start>git>git bash

The dos command prompt for windows is in the start>accessories>command prompt path
